# compiler
Custom J language compiler programmed in C

The J language is a custom language used in the CIS 2400 - Computer Systems
class at the University of Pennsylvania and this is a compiler developed
to convert the J language code to assembly code. The assembly language
used is also a custom LC4 language used at the University of Pennsylvania,
but it is similar in syntax and structure to ARM assembly languages.
